# Expectations-in-SIA


In this subject, I expect to learn how different parts of a system such as hardware, software, and networks work together. I want to understand how integration is applied in real-world IT projects and how it supports the needs of businesses and organizations.

I also expect this course to help me improve my problem-solving skills, especially in designing and analyzing system architectures. Learning about tools and methods used in system integration will prepare me for future projects and professional work.

Lastly, I look forward to hands-on activities where I can apply what I learn. I believe this subject will strengthen my IT foundation and give me practical skills that I can use in my future career.
